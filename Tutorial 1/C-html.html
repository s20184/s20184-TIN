		Precept Twenty-One: 'Be Aware of Your Surroundings'.
		Don't just walk along staring at the ground!
		You need to look up every so often, to make sure nothing takes you by surprise.<br>
		Precept Twenty-Two: 'Abandon the Nest'.
		As soon as I could, I left my birthplace and made my way out into the world. Do not linger in the nest. There is nothing for you there.<br>
		Precept Twenty-Three: 'Identify the Foe's Weak Point'.
		Every foe you encounter has a weak point, such as a crack in their shell or being asleep. You must constantly be alert and scrutinising your enemy to detect their weakness!<br>
		Precept Twenty-Four: 'Strike the Foe's Weak Point'.
		Once you have identified your foe's weak point as per the previous precept, strike it. This will instantly destroy them.

		Precept Twenty-Five: 'Protect Your Own Weak Point'.
		Be aware that your foe will try to identify your weak point, so you must protect it. The best protection? Never having a weak point in the first place.<br>
		Precept Twenty-Six: 'Don't Trust Your Reflection'.
		When peering at certain shining surfaces, you may see a copy of your own face. The face will mimic your movements and seems similar to your own, but I don't think it can be trusted.<br>
		Precept Twenty-Seven: 'Eat As Much As You Can'.
		When having a meal, eat as much as you possibly can. This gives you extra energy, and means you can eat less frequently.<br>
		Precept Twenty-Eight: 'Don't Peer Into the Darkness'.
		If you peer into the darkness and can't see anything for too long, your mind will start to linger over old memories. Memories are to be avoided, as per Precept Four.<br>
		Precept Twenty-Nine: 'Develop Your Sense of Direction'.
		It's easy to get lost when travelling through winding, twisting caverns. Having a good sense of direction is like having a magical map inside of your head. Very useful.<br>
		Precept Thirty: 'Never Accept a Promise'.
		Spurn the promises of others, as they are always broken. Promises of love or betrothal are to be avoided especially.

		Precept Thirty-One: 'Disease Lives Inside of Dirt.
		You'll get sick if you spend too much time in filthy places. If you are staying in someone else's home, demand the highest level of cleanliness from your host.<br>
		Precept Thirty-Two: 'Names Have Power'.
		Names have power, and so to name something is to grant it power. I myself named my nail 'Life Ender'. Do not steal the name I came up with! Invent your own!<br>
		Precept Thirty-Three: 'Show the Enemy No Respect'.
		Being gallant to your enemies is no virtue! If someone opposes you, they don't deserve respect or kindness or mercy.<br>
		Precept Thirty-Four: 'Don't Eat Immediately Before Sleeping'.
		This can cause restlessness and indigestion. It's just common sense.<br>
		Precept Thirty-Five: 'Up is Up, Down is Down'.
		If you fall over in the darkness, it can be easy to lose your bearing and forget which way is up. Keep this precept in mind!

		Precept Thirty-Six: 'Eggshells are brittle'.
		Once again, this precept explains itself.<br>
		Precept Thirty-Seven: 'Borrow, But Do Not Lend'.
		If you lend and are repaid, you gain nothing. If you borrow but do not repay, you gain everything.<br>
		Precept Thirty-Eight: 'Beware the Mysterious Force'.
		A mysterious force bears down on us from above, pushing us downwards. If you spend too long in the air, the force will crush you against the ground and destroy you. Beware!<br>
		Precept Thirty-Nine: 'Eat Quickly and Drink Slowly'.
		Your body is a delicate thing and you must fuel it with great deliberation. Food must go in as fast as possible, but fluids at a slower rate.<br>
		Precept Forty: 'Obey No Law But Your Own'.
		Laws written by others may inconvenience you or be a burden. Let your own desires be the only law.<br>
		Precept Forty-One: 'Learn to Detect Lies'.
		When others speak, they usually lie. Scrutinise and question them relentlessly until they reveal their deceit.<br>
		Precept Forty-Two: 'Spend Geo When You Have It'.
		Some will cling onto their Geo, even taking it into the dirt with them when they die. It is better to spend it when you can, so you can enjoy various things in life.<br>
		Precept Forty-Three: 'Never Forgive'.
		If someone asks forgiveness of you, for instance a brother of yours, always deny it. That brother, or whoever it is, doesn't deserve such a thing.
